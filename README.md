## Kenneth Desrosiers

I am a Computer Science student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During this past term, I studied Human Computer Interaction (HCI) through a variety of different projects.

### My Projects

I have completed a total of six different projects over the course of the term that touch upon different aspects HCI, such as data visualization, facial recognition, and virtual reality.

### Project 1:
The first project was focused on finding good and bad design within WPI's website(s).

The second project was about creating a mobile webpage to cater to a specific demographic.

### Project 3:
The third project was about displaying data in a way people would find easy to understand. Ours was "parents with children within 20 miles of Worcester"

### Project 4:
In this project, we had to create a chatbot that had a conversation with a user on a tense topic. My group explored Anti-Vaxxers.

### Project 5:
This project was about using Affectiva's facial recognition library in order to detect emotions and make the user happy. My group worked on a personality test.

### Project 6:
For the final project in this class, we had to design a virtual reality scene. There were no guidelines, only to create.
